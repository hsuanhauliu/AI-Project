# Machine-Improvised Music Program
This was an AI course final project. We designed an AI program that can learn from various single-melody music files and come up with its own version of music.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 2.7
- [python-midi](https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi) library

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/hsuanhauliu/machine-improvised-music.git
```

### Usage
See demo.py and demo2.py for examples.

### Notes
Both MIM_functions.py and MIM_uniqueApproach.py files contain functions that you can use to train the AI and generate music.
